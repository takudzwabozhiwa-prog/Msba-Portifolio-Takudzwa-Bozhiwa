# Individual Contribution

## What did you personally contribute to the most?
I contributed primarily to building and implementing the XGBoost model used to predict customer churn. This included preparing the dataset, splitting the data into training and testing sets, training the model, and evaluating its performance. I also helped interpret the model results to understand which features were most important in predicting churn.

## What is one decision or approach you personally advocated for and why?
I advocated for using XGBoost as the main modeling approach because it is a powerful and efficient machine learning algorithm that performs well on structured tabular data. XGBoost can capture complex relationships between variables and typically provides strong predictive performance compared to simpler models.

## What are one or two lessons learned from the case competition, and what would you add or improve if you had more time?
One lesson I learned was the importance of proper data preprocessing and feature selection in improving model performance. If I had more time, I would experiment with additional feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to further improve model accuracy. I would also explore model explainability techniques such as SHAP values to better understand how features influence churn predictions.
