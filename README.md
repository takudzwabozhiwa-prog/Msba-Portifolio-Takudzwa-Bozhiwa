# Customer Churn Prediction Using XGBoost

## Business Problem
The goal of this project was to predict which customers are likely to churn using machine learning. Customer churn leads to lost revenue, so identifying high-risk customers allows the company to take proactive retention actions.

## Key Results
- Built an XGBoost model to predict customer churn probability
- Identified key features influencing churn behavior
- Generated predictions to help target retention strategies

## How to Run the Code
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open GROUP_8_XGBOOST_MODEL.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
3. Install required libraries such as pandas, numpy, sklearn, and xgboost
4. Run all cells in order
5. Review model results and predictions

## Limitation or Risk
One limitation is that the model relies on historical data and may not fully capture future customer behavior changes.
